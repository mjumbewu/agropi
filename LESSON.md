0. Using the terminal
  * pinout

1. Setting up and reading from GPIO pins
  * Input vs output
  * Pins for data I/O
  * The numbering of pins on the board

2. Responding to GPIO input
  * Circuits 1 -- voltage, ground, and IO pins
  * Calling functions in Python (setmode, setup, print)
  * Python loops
  * Conditionals in Python

3. Causing GPIO output
  * Circuits 2 -- relays
  * Creating functions in Python


Further Construction
--------------------

- Events instead of while loops
- Web services for remote control
